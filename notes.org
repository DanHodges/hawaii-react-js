* Intro
** About me
   Work at LifeWay
   Likes my keyboard
   Lots of epubs
   Lib for epubs
** Expectations
   Learning pyramid [[http://www.fitnyc.edu/images/learning-pyramid.jpg]] (disputable accuracy- stay calm!)
   Questions rather than answers
* About this project
** Genesis
   Silly comments and big aspirations
** Original Plan- out the window!
   ScalaJS-React
   ScalaJS-React [[https://japgolly.github.io/scalajs-react/]]
   Because I saw [[https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/]]
   What to do?
   (if (like-parens?) [[https://github.com/omcljs/om]])
   But that's exhuasting... Learning's hard ... how about just types and functions? [[https://github.com/tysoncadenhead/coffee-ratios]]
** Beyond "hello, world!", but not by much
   Beginner friendly syntax and setup (CRA duh).
   A couple stateless components
   No egregious mistakes
   Good test coverage
   Limited extra dependencies

   Low time commitment
   Make things move on a screen
   Easy to host?
